## AI generated podcast using Google NotebookLM

### Some thoughts on the above AI generated podcast:
- It was created using NotebookLM using the below prompt + the attached scripts for eps 1-30
  ```
  Write a 15-20 minute podcast recap of Wolf 359 episodes 1-30, summarizing the key events and character developments aboard the Hephaestus station. Focus on major plot points, evolving relationships, and critical mysteries that emerge. Keep the tone consistent with the series' style. Present it as an engaging catchup narrative for listeners, covering only events shown in the provided scripts.Stick strictly to events from the provided scripts
  ```

- Notice that I have mentioned that it should only reference the provided script, nothing else. This is because I tried generating this a few times before, but it was going off track and making up events (check previous repo commits for reference)
- I listened to it, it was mostly fine:
  - The character name pronunciations are wrong (or atleast different from the original material)
  - If listened to carefully, it still makes up few plot points (hallucinations)
  - So at the moment the tech is not perfect, but is still good enough that creating an AI podcast is quick and effortless, looking forward to see how this tech evolves over time
